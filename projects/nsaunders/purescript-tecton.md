With Tecton, you can confidently author CSS using a statically-typed language,
protecting you from a wide range of CSS errorsâ€”some rather obscure. I built
Tecton after finding other statically-typed CSS solutions to be cumbersome and
outdated, limited to subsets of CSS that would not meet the needs of most
real-world projects. On the other hand, Tecton uses advanced features of
PureScript to deliver a familiar, flexible, and reliable CSS authoring
experience.
