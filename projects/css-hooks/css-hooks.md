In recent years, frontend developers have questioned whether traditional CSS
"best practices" are a good fit for component-based architecture (like React).

CSS-in-JS and Atomic CSS to overcome their technical limitations around hover
effects, responsive design, etc. CSS Hooks offers a dramatically simpler
browser-native solution built upon the programmability of CSS Variables.
