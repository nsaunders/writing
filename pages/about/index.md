Greetings, and thanks for your interest!

I'm a passionate programmer with 20 years of professional experience in the
field of software engineering and web development. At 35 years old, I've
dedicated a significant portion of my life to programming, which has given me
exposure to a wide range of various technologies.

Over the past several years, I've maintained a consistent focus on front-end
development. After experimenting with other frameworks like Angular and Svelte,
as well as Web Components, I decided to focus my efforts exclusively on React.

Currently, I hold the position of Lead Design System Engineer at a prominent
company, where I spearhead the development and maintenance of a React component
library. My role involves building and maintaining components in collaboration
with my UX design partner and helping product teams to adopt them successfully.

Meanwhile, on personal time, I'm an avid functional programming enthusiast,
particularly interested in PureScript. I have developed and maintain several
libraries, including the noteworthy [Tecton](https://purescri.pt/tecton), which
delivers a uniquely type-safe and flexible CSS authoring experience.

I've decided to start this technical blog as a platform to share my insights,
findings, and ideas related to React, TypeScript, and UI/UXâ€”and maybe even a bit
of functional programming. My motivation for creating this blog stems from a
desire to document my discoveries for future reference, to help colleagues
understand my technical reasoning, and to offer valuable insights that can
accelerate the progress of fellow programmers in their own journeys.

As a technical blogger, I believe in the power of programming to bring joy and
satisfaction, but I also recognize that it carries its fair share of challenges
and complexities. I advocate for making good technology choices and sensible
design decisions to strike the right balance between meeting short-term
objectives and ensuring long-term maintainability. My approach revolves around
creating accessible content that emphasizes the importance of learning from
existing solutions and appreciating the impact our code has on others and our
future selves.

Above all, I firmly believe in the value of simplicity in design. Simple designs
often translate to more reliable and maintainable solutions, and this principle
guides my work and content creation.

With a pragmatic mindset, I encourage original thinking and challenge
conventional ideas when they might hinder progress without valid reasons. My
blog aims to provide readers with alternative perspectives and innovative
approaches to technical problems, encouraging them to think outside the box and
explore possibilities others might dismiss.

Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I look forward to sharing my
knowledge and experiences with you.
